# Project-1 Scientific Calculator--
# Problem statement 
In many practical scenarios users need to perform a diverse range of functions that ranges from basic functions like the algebraic functions to more complex scientific functions to data visualisation, in such a situation, the need to switch between different tools like calculator, plotter , grapher etc makes the overall computation process slow and inefficient. There is a need for a unified tool that combines all these functions into one easy to use tool.
# Scope of the project
The program is useful for many case scenarios but is limited to the command line input based interface. The main use of the program lies in the combined funcitionality that it offers. This project however, due to the limitations of the current knowledge has a large room for overall development. With more and more knowledge of the python language, the program can be modified for a much wider usage case scenario and can be made more user friendly with an interface that would be understandable and accessible by almost all the basic technology users.
# Target users
The target users of this program are the users with need for quick mathematical functions and basic plotting tools in one place. Users who fit this description are high school/college students, educators (for quickly demonstrating the functions to the students), entry level programmers (for basic quick and easy calculations/data handling) etc.
# High-level features 
The program offers a total of 18 functions that are listed as follows:-

Algebraic Functions
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Random Number Generator (within a user-defined range)

Scientific Functions:-
Exponential,Logarithm (of a user input argument,with a user input base), Factorial,Fibonacci Sequence ( upto a certain user input terms), Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Cosecant, Secant, Cotangent (with user input in degrees)

Data Visualization Functions:-
Numerical Line Graph (User-defined axes labels, x-axis, y-axis values, and title)

Bar Graph (User-defined categories, corresponding numerical values, title, and axes labels)

Pie Chart (User-defined labels, sizes, and colors

The main feature of the program is the combined funcionality of the mathematical functions along with the data visualisation tools, as in many affordable calculators the data visulaisers are absent.
