## Scientific-Calculator--Project-1-Vityarthi
Overview of the project--
The project is a scientific calculator that allows the user to choose from and perform a total of 18 functions. The user interacts with the program by providing input that then is used by the program to generate the output.

## Features--
The calculator offers a total of 18 functions that are further divided into three groups. Algebraic,Scientific and Data Visualisation. Algebraic--> It contains the basic algebraic functions that a calcualtor posseses, namely addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and a random number generator which generates a random real number within a given range.

Scientific--> This section contains more advanced scientific functions namely Exponential, Logarithim, Factorial, Fibonacchi, sine(), cosine(), tangent(), cosecant(), secant(), cotangent(). All functions work within the scientific laws and the fibonacchi functions displays the first n terms of the fibonacchi series where n is provided by the user.

Data Visualisation--> This section contains tools that help in visualising the available data namely Numerical Line Graph- which plots a line graph for avilable set of abscissa and ordinate values. Bar chart- Which plots the available numberical values for certain categories. Pie chart- Which plots a pie chart for the avaialable numerical values on certain categories.

Every function works by taking the required input from the user and performing the necessary calculations. Since there are many ways to give numerical inputs the correct way to provide the input is stated at the required steps.

## Technologies/tools used
The program has been created by using Python language ,in creating this program the code explained in the class and on the vityarthi portal have been used. Along with the programmer written code, the program uses modules present in python namely numpy,scipy,math,random,matplotlib to perform certain desired functions. The program in terms of structure uses many concepts such as loops, nested functions/loops,conditionals,boolean statements etc in order to enhance the overall usability and funcionality.

## Steps to install & run the project
The program can be run in two ways.

First by opening the Project-1 Scientific Calculator.py in a python idle and then running the code.

Second by opening the Project-1 Scientific Calculator.ipynb file and running the code cell in jupyter coding platform.

In both the cases after performing one function the code block will end and to execute another function, the code block will have to be run again.

## Instructions for testing
The program can be tested by running the code multiple times and providing different inputs in order to access different functions. Further each funciton can be tested with different types of data inputs in order to validate the intended funcionality.
